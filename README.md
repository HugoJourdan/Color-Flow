# GLYPH COLOR ðŸ†š LAYER COLOR


Glyphs and glyph layers can be marked with color labels. Control-click or right-click a glyph to apply one of the twelve
predefined colors.  
Hold down the Option key to define or clear the color label of the current layer. The glyph color spans across the entire glyph cell.  
The layer color is drawn on the right half of the cell if a glyph color is set or across the entire cell with a cut-out in the top left if no glyph
color is set.

| Glyph Color | Layer Color | Glyph+Layer Color |

* ðŸŸ¢ â†’ Anchors placed
* ðŸ”µ â†’ Spacing set

# REQUIREMENTS

Color Flow requires a `color.txt` file stored in either `~/Library/Application Support/Glyphs 3/info` or the same directory as the current Glyphs source file. Preference is given to the latter allowing for the sharing of the `color.txt` file with glyphs source files to retain labelling information between project contributors. 

The `color.txt` file requires the formatting `colorName=meaning`, with each key on a newline and with no space surrounding the '='.  
An example, with the defined colorNames is given below. 

```
red=Step 1
orange=Step 2
brown=Step 3
yellow=Step 4
lightGreen=Step 5
darkGreen=Step 6
lightBlue=Step7
darkBlue=Step 8
purple=Step 9
magenta=Step 10
lightGray=Step 11
charcoal=Step 12
```

# CUSTOMIZE

The whole point of Color Flow is that meaning and order of colors can be customized, so that each designer can build his own workflow.  
Color order can be modified by changing line order and color can be hidden by removing it's meaning.
An example, with a customize `color.txt` is given below. 

```
red=
orange=
brown=
purple=Outline corrected
lightGreen=Anchors placed
darkGreen=
lightBlue=Spacing set
darkBlue=
yellow=Ready to Export
magenta=
lightGray=
charcoal=
```

Display in Color Flow UI:
* ðŸŸ£ â†’ Outline corrected
* ðŸŸ¢ â†’ Anchors placed
* ðŸ”µ â†’ Spacing set
* ðŸŸ¡ â†’ Ready to Export

# HOW IT WORK

Layers Color Labels are set automaticaly according to checkboxes. Color set is the precedent color of the first uncheck checkbox.  
In the following example Layer Color is set to `Orange` because even if `Light Green` and `Yellow` are âœ… , `Brown` is uncheck, so color set is the color that precedes it.
