# COLOR FLOW SHORTCUT

Instead of checking boxes manually you can do it with a shortcut.
For that you have to :
1. Place "Color Flow Shortcut" Folder in `~/Users/hugojourdan/Library/Application Support/Glyphs 3/Scripts`
2. In Glyph Preferences > Shortcuts, search "Color Flow" and assign a shortcut for each item. (I personnaly use Control+Number as shortcuts)
